# Othello Console Game

This repository contains a simple console-based implementation of the game Othello (also known as Reversi).

## Requirements

The game only relies on Python 3 and has no additional dependencies.

## Usage

Run the game from the repository root:

```bash
python3 othello.py
```

Two players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers (1-8). Enter `q` to quit at any time. When no valid moves remain for either player, the game ends and the final score is displayed.
